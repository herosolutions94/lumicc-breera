The quality of the projects and their budgets are average at best.</li>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"share_article_blk\">\r\n                        <h4>Share this article:</h4>\r\n                        <div className=\"social_media\">\r\n                            <Link to=\"\">\r\n                                <img src=\"images/story/instagram.svg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                            </Link>\r\n                            <Link to=\"\">\r\n                                <img src=\"images/story/facebook.svg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                            </Link>\r\n                            <Link to=\"\">\r\n                                <img src=\"images/story/twitter.svg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                            </Link>\r\n                            <Link to=\"\">\r\n                                <img src=\"images/story/linkedin.svg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n                            </Link>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <RelatedBlog />\r\n        </main>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\nexport default BlogDetail;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
